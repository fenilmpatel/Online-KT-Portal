## Introduction:
-  Python base online portal made using flask and relational database PostgreSQL.
- Here we used  python with flask library along with css/html to expose end user. it is python flask app which used PostgreSQL python library psycopg2 for running relational database operation through python app.
- psycopg2 is responsible to make connection through database and post request in flask.

## Challenges:

- I have face many Challenges in this project as specifically creating flask app using postgresql with adding html/css on top of that.
- how to work with psycopg2 for relational operations using python is bit Challenging part
- next is deployement of this application so everyone can use it. this part is most crusial and Challenging for me.
- after deployement how to maintain this app on cloud required bit knowledge about cloud.
